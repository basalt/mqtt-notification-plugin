# Origins

This is a fork of the [MQTT Notification Plugin on GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci/mqtt-notification-plugin). In difference to its ancestor, this MQTT Notification Plugin gives more information about the build status and the artefacts in form of a JSON string if nothing else is defined.

## MQTT Notification Plugin for Jenkins CI

This is a Jenkins notifier to publish build results using the lightweight [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) protocol.

### Before You Begin

In order to use the plugin you will need an MQTT broker to which to publish the notifications.

### Wiki

Please see the [Jenkins-CI wiki page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/MQTT+Notification+Plugin) for further details.
